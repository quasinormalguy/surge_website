          <h1>A mosaic of musings and marvels</h1>
		  <p>
			In the quiet interstices of daily life, certain impressions linger.
			<br>
			I intend to use this space to curate such moments: 
			<br>
			reflections that stirred the mind, 
			<br>
			nuances that caught the eye,
			<br>
			ideas that resonated beyond their initial encounter.
			<br>
			Some of spontaneous curiosity but mostly deliberate contemplations.

			OUR ANCESTORS UNDERSTOOD origins by extrapolating from their own experience. How else could they have done it? So the Universe was hatched from a cosmic egg, or conceived in the sexual congress of a mother god and a father god, or was a kind of product of the Creator's workshop -- perhaps the latest of many flawed attempts. And the Universe was not much bigger than we see, and not much older than our written or oral records, and nowhere very different from places that we know.
			<br>
			Then science came along and taught us that we are not the measure of all things, that there are wonders unimagined, that the Universe is not obliged to conform to what we consider comfortable or plausible. We have learned something  out the idiosyncratic nature of our common sense. Science has carried human self-consciousness to a higher level. This is surely a rite of passage, a step towards maturity. It contrasts starkly with the childishness and narcissism of our pre-Copernican notions.
			<br>
			WHAT DO WE REALLY WANT from philosophy and religion? Palliatives? Therapy? Comfort? Do we want reassuring fables or an understanding of our actual circumstances? Dismay that the Universe does not conform to our preferences seems childish. You might think that grown-ups would be ashamed to put such disappointments into print. The fashionable way of doing this is not to blame the Universe -- which seems truly pointless -- but rather to blame the means by which we know the Universe, namely science.
			<br>
			IF YOU LIVED two or three millennia ago, there was no shame in holding that the Universe was made for us. It was an appealing thesis consistent with everything we knew; it was what the most learned among us taught without qualification. But we have found out much since then. Defending such a position today amounts to willful disregard of the evidence, and a flight from self-knowledge.
			<br>
			To our ancestors there was much in Nature to be afraid of -- lightning, storms, earthquakes, volcanos, plagues, drought, long winters. Religions arose in part as attempts to propitiate and control, if not much to understand, the disorderly aspect of Nature. The scientific revolution permitted us to glimpse an underlying ordered Universe in which there was a literal harmony of the worlds (Johannes Kepler's phrase). If we understand Nature, there is a prospect of controlling it or at least mitigating the harm it may bring. In this sense, science brought hope.
			<br>
			There is in this Universe much of what seems to be design. Every time we come upon it, we breathe a sigh of relief. We are forever hoping to find, or at least safely deduce, a Designer. But instead, we repeatedly discover that natural processes -- collisional selection of worlds, say, or natural selection of gene pools, or even the convection pattern in a pot of boiling water -- can extract order out of chaos, and deceive us into deducing purpose where there is none. In everyday life, we often sense -- in the bedrooms of teenagers, or in national politics -- that chaos is natural, and order imposed from above. While there are deeper regularities in the Universe than the simple circumstances we generally describe as orderly, all that order, simple and complex, seems to derive from laws of Nature established at the Big Bang (or earlier), rather than as a consequence of belated intervention by an imperfect deity. "God is to be found in the details" is the famous dictum of the German scholar Aby Warburg. But, amid much elegance and precision, the details of life and the Universe also exhibit haphazard, jury-rigged arrangements and much poor planning. What shall we make of this: an edifice abandoned early in construction by the architect?
			<br>
			The evidence, so far at least and laws of Nature aside, does not require a Designer. Maybe there is one hiding, maddeningly unwilling to be revealed. Sometimes it seems a very slender hope.
			<br>
			The significance of our lives and our fragile planet is then determined only by our own wisdom and courage. We are the custodians of life’s meaning. We long for a Parent to care for us, to forgive us our errors, to save us from our childish mistakes. But knowledge is preferable to ignorance. Better by far to embrace the hard truth than a reassuring fable.
			<br>
			If we crave some cosmic purpose, then let us find ourselves a worthy goal.

		<h2 class="major collapsible">In memory of Prof. Kumar Chitre</h2>
		<div class="blog-content">
		  <p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashikumar_Chitre" target="_blank">[wiki]</a>
			<br>
			We the students of CEBS would only appear on the last chapter of the admirable life that our beloved Chitre sir lived. But with no doubt I can say that no person has ever had a more profound influence on us than Prof. Chitre. He was the first exhibit of a true gentleman to us, how truly a person of science should be; a preview of our aspiration. Personally, Prof. Chitre was the person who unfurled the mind of the small town boy that I was. My inquest into Astrophysics is something I owe to him, afterall he is the one who taught me about the stars and of the fluids which make these stars.
			I am sure that none of my batchmates from CEBS can forget our first class with Chitre sir. It was the first year course “Glimpses of Contemporary Sciences”, and he was taking the last few lectures. On the first day of his lecture, as the class started he leaned onto the wheeled teacher’s desk of PF-AG-14. The desk slipped and he almost fell but balanced himself - we all had a mini heart-attack that day. The desk on the other hand could not be saved and it fell along with the computer on it with a loud crash. Prof. Chitre looked at the table and then at us, and smirked – the same one which he always had before saying something witty – and said “Well… The Universe started with a bang!” After that, in the five years we spent at CEBS, we were and have been completely frank with him on any matter under the sun, and he would listen to us with a smile, ponder on the subject with a finger on his chin and provide us a solution. It hurts me too much that I will not be able to tell him about all the interesting projects I am working on and will work on, and I feel utterly revolted that I now cannot seek his advice on all matters of physics and even life. The extraordinary thing about his advice was its sobriety; he would teach us to fly but never forgot to remind us of the “flight of Icarus”.
			CEBS – which he always fondly referred to as a gurukul – has lost its guru. It is a void that will remain vacant in all its future. He was the most dynamic person with the most humble and feeble of appearances. The torch is now passed but we shall never forget that it is now onto his proteges that it never dims. I will always remain fond of him and his wit, and will never forget all the cups of coffee we had together. He was the greatest storyteller, we used to love his stories in our classes and beyond, but little did we know he made us into one; we will be carrying forward his stories and stories about him. And onwards, he will survive. If I had a last chance to meet him, I would let the theatre-phile in me take over and following the narrative of the movie “Dead Poets Society”, I will find my balance up that dangling desk of PF-AG-14 and pass my salutations to him in words of Walt Whitman – “O Captain! My Captain! Our fearful trip is done.”
