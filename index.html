							<!-- Here are three paragraphs where you can fill out information about yourself -->
							My name is Swarnim Shashank (स्वर्णिम् शशांक – which translates to golden moon so I also like to write it simply as 金月).
							I hail from a small city in the gangetic plains of northern India, however I grew up in a small industrial town in the foothills of the Vindhya range.
							I became interested in astronomy during my wonder years, through reading popsci and watching numerous documentaries, and then later developed 
							interest in coding in high school. This has now lead me to working in astrophysics research - where I study the 
							astrophysical systems using numerical simulations.
							<br>
							I am currently working on problems related to relativistic astrophysics in the strong gravity regime. 
							My works span both in X-ray and gravitational wave astrophysics. 
							<br>
							I have varied interests and like discussing science, philosophy, music, movies, food and 
							<a href='https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html' target='_blank'>FLOSS</a>. 
							I play guitar, bass guitar and harmonium, and have a diploma in Hindustani classical music.

								<b>Simulations of Accreting Black Holes</b><br>By numerically solving MHD equations coupled in a strong gravity backgroud,
								I model the acretion process. These processes are the most efficient engines in the whole Universe and they can reveal a lot
								of physics which is nearly impossible to study in the terrestrail laboratory.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Modelling of X-ray Emissions</b><br>Using a codes for ray-tracing and radiation transport, I model the X-ray emissions from accreting
								systems. Using a suite of simulations I create data analysis models which could directly be used for observational data of X-ray missions.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Testing General Relativity</b><br>The theory of general relativity from Einstein presents the forefront in understand the nature
								of gravity in the Universe. However, the theory still breaks at the centre of balck holes and the big bang creating singularities.
								Using the data from X-ray and gravitational wave observatories, I test general relativity to look for any new physics. These observations
								allow us to test the theory in a strong gravoty regime which in not possible on Earth.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Simulations of neutron stars</b><br>Using numerical relativity codes, I simulate single and binary neutron stars to their various properties.
								Such as the emissions of gravitational waves, neutron star asteroseismoogy, equations of state and, the effects of magnetic fields.
